            <h1>Free Courses to Learn to Program</h1>
            <p>
                There are several pages that teach you the program from scratch, there are people who without investing a lot of money learn infinities of things, but of course, doing courses like this merits having a high degree of commitment and a lot of discipline, it is not impossible but it does not take away the difficulty .
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as we want to learn new things, our motivation goes down, either due to time or the difficulties of the path to learn, and if we do not have an engine that drives us (in this case a monetary investment) then we put aside what we want to learn and we deviate from the path. If you are one of those people who can self-motivate without making monetary investments, then you should finish reading this because then I will mention several popular pages to learn and practice programming:
